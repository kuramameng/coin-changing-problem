Write a JavaScript or EcmaScript6 program to simulate a cash register clerk who makes change.  

Its one function should be to take a purchase price and a payment amount and return the change using all of the US dollar denominations $20 and less including pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and fifty cent pieces.  

Assume that there is a limited supply (possibly zero) of each denomination 
to draw from in your register and that the change will include the minimum amount of each denomination needed.  

For example, a payment of $1.00 for a purchase of $0.89 will return 
change of a dime and a penny, or if there are no dimes, then two nickels and a penny.

Replenish the available currency stock from the payments and simulate a series of transactions 
to show multiple scenarios.
 
You should include a simple browser UI for accessing your program.
